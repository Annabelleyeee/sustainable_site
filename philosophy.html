        <h1>Our Sustainability Philosophy</h1>

        <h2 class="philosophy">At Rangi, we believe a sustainable school is a great place to learn, where students
            develop a social conscience, self-esteem and reach high standards of achievement.</h2>
        <div class="philosophy-container">
            <p>The Sustainability Project has been established to manage the phased implementation of initiatives
                developed by a team of staff and students. We believe that a sustainable school prepares young people
                for a lifetime of sustainable living, through its teaching, values and its day to day practices. It is
                guided by a commitment to care for: </p>

            <ul>
                <li> Oneself (our health and wellÂ­being) </li>
                <li>Each other (across cultures, distances and generations) </li>
                <li>The environment (both locally and globally) </li>
            </ul>

            <p>We acknowledge and honour the status of tangata whenua and the value of indigenous knowledge in enriching
                and
                guiding learning for sustainability. We foster the traditional Maori perspective of our
                interconnectedness
                with nature. Care instils responsibility, and as a school we accept the responsibility to develop
                environmental, social and cultural sustainability within our community by respecting other people,
                cultures
                and the natural world. </p>

            <h3>Food and Drink</h3>
            <p> We supply healthy, local and sustainable food and drink. Showing strong commitments to the
                environment, social responsibility and animal welfare, as well as maximising our use of local suppliers
                and
                onsite production. </p>

            <h3>Energy and Water</h3>
            <p> We endeavor to design for and operate with energy efficiency, using renewable energies and
                energy conservation strategies. Working to minimize water usage and water conservation techniques. We
                use
                sustainable landscape design and planting methods. </p>

            <h3> Travel and Traffic</h3>
            <p>We encourage sustainable travel and provide facilities for healthier, less polluting or
                less dangerous modes of transport. We promote carpooling networks within the school community and
                established a bus service from Rolleston. </p>

            <h3>Purchasing and waste</h3>
            <p>We promote sustainable procurement and procedures, using goods and services of high
                environmental and ethical standards from local sources where practicable. Increasing value for money by
                reducing, reusing, repairing, recycling and composting as much as possible. </p>

            <h3>Buildings and Grounds</h3>
            <p>Rangi Ruru grounds bring students closer to the natural world, capture their
                imaginations through the outdoors, and help them learn about sustainable living, environmentally
                friendly
                practices and biodiversity. Our buildings are designed in ways that visibly demonstrate sustainable
                development and innovation. </p>

            <h3>Inclusion and Participation</h3>
            <p>We ensure social inclusion to enable all members of the school community to
                participate fully in school life while instilling a long lasting respect for human rights, freedoms,
                cultures and creative expression. </p>

            <h3>Wellbeing</h3>
            <p>We encourage an interactive process of becoming aware of and practicing healthy choices to create
                a more successful and sustainable lifestyle. Promoting awareness of multiple aspects of wellbeing
                including
                emotional, physical, social, environmental, occupational, spiritual and intellectual. </p>

            <h3>Local Connections</h3>
            <p>We create sustainable partnerships with the local community. Engaging collaboratively with
                people and organisations to improve the environment and quality of life in the community. </p>

            <h3>Global Dimensions</h3>
            <p>We endeavor to practice global citizenship, enriching our educational mission with
                activities and partnerships that improve the lives of people living in other parts of the world. </p>
