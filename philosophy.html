        <h1>Our Sustainability Philosophy</h1>


        <p>We believe that a sustainable school prepares young people for a lifetime of sustainable living, through its teaching, values
            and its day to day practices. It is guided by a commitment to care for: </p>

        <ul>
            <li> Oneself (our health and wellÂ­being) </li>
            <li>Each other (across cultures, distances and generations) </li>
            <li>The environment (both locally and globally) </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We acknowledge and honour the status of tangata whenua and the value of indigenous knowledge in enriching and
            guiding learning for sustainability. We foster the traditional Maori perspective of our interconnectedness
            with nature. Care instils responsibility, and as a school we accept the responsibility to develop
            environmental, social and cultural sustainability within our community by respecting other people, cultures
            and the natural world. </p>

        <p>Food and Drink We supply healthy, local and sustainable food and drink. Showing strong commitments to the
            environment, social responsibility and animal welfare, as well as maximising our use of local suppliers and
            onsite production. </p>

        <p> Energy and Water We endeavor to design for and operate with energy efficiency, using renewable energies and
            energy conservation strategies. Working to minimize water usage and water conservation techniques. We use
            sustainable landscape design and planting methods. </p>

        <p>Travel and Traffic We encourage sustainable travel and provide facilities for healthier, less polluting or
            less dangerous modes of transport. We promote carpooling networks within the school community and
            established a bus service from Rolleston. </p>

        <p>Purchasing and Waste We promote sustainable procurement and procedures, using goods and services of high
            environmental and ethical standards from local sources where practicable. Increasing value for money by
            reducing, reusing, repairing, recycling and composting as much as possible. </p>

        <p>Buildings and Grounds Rangi Ruru grounds bring students closer to the natural world, capture their
            imaginations through the outdoors, and help them learn about sustainable living, environmentally friendly
            practices and biodiversity. Our buildings are designed in ways that visibly demonstrate sustainable
            development and innovation. </p>

        <p>Inclusion and Participation We ensure social inclusion to enable all members of the school community to
            participate fully in school life while instilling a long lasting respect for human rights, freedoms,
            cultures and creative expression. </p>

        <p> Wellbeing We encourage an interactive process of becoming aware of and practicing healthy choices to create
            a more successful and sustainable lifestyle. Promoting awareness of multiple aspects of wellbeing including
            emotional, physical, social, environmental, occupational, spiritual and intellectual. </p>

        <p>Local Connections We create sustainable partnerships with the local community. Engaging collaboratively with
            people and organisations to improve the environment and quality of life in the community. </p>

        <p> Global Dimensions We endeavor to practice global citizenship, enriching our educational mission with
            activities and partnerships that improve the lives of people living in other parts of the world. </p>
