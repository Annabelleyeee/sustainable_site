        <h1>Goals and Initiatives</h1>

        <p>The overacrching goal for sustainbility at Rangi Ruru is to: Create greater awareness and participation in
            Rangi’s sustainability and service initiatives through education, communication and collaboration within the
            school and wider community through service, Eco-Action and community collaborations</p>

        <h3>Current Goals</h3>

        <h4>Biodigester</h4>
        <p>We are seeking funding and the opportunity to work alongside business to design and install a biodigestor
            onsite. This will allow Rangi to convert green waste to biogas (to replace non-renewable natural gas
            currently used for cooking in the Boarding House and heating in Te Koroha and the pool). This investment
            enables substantial economic savings of which 60% will be reinvested into sustainability projects once
            establishment costs are covered after twenty six months.
        </p>

        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Establish the use of 100% renewable energy at Rangi and provide a high degree of energy independence for
                all parts of the school’s operation</li>
            <li>Take advantage of the energy sources already present onsite (and potentially within the wider community
                by using green waste from neighbours to create biogas) </li>
            <li>Reduce the waste discharged by the school and reduce waste disposal cost </li>
            <li>Significantly lower the operating costs of the school, pool and boarding facility </li>
        </ul>
