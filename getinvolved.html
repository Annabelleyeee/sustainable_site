        <h1> How you can get Involved</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>Use cloth bags for shopping to reduce your impact on the environment. New Zealanders use over 1.6
                billion plastic bags in the home every year. 4.3 million are being thrown away each day!</li>

            <li>Walk or bike, bus or car pool to school/work. Rangi is surrounded by beautiful parks and reserves. If
                you need to drive, park a few blocks away and walk some of the way. Incidental exercise adds up,
                increases fitness and makes you feel good.</li>

            <li>Check exfoliating scrubs, facial cleansers and toothpaste ingredients for plastic microbeads. Evidence
                shows these and other tiny particles of plastic are entering our waterways and embedding themselves in
                the marine food chain.</li>

            <li>Research and support effective charities, proven through evidence to be doing the most possible good
                with donated money. For further information email c.low@rangiruru.school.nz</li>

            <li>Soft plastics capable of being scrunched into a ball can now be dropped back to New World, The Warehouse
                or Pac n Save to be reused and made into fitness circuits, road bollards, park benches and playground
                equipment. Bags to collect include bread bags, frozen food bags, toilet paper packaging, confectionary
                and biscuit wrap, chip bags, pasta, cereal and rice bags, courier bags etc. A soft plastics collection
                has also been set up at Rangi. </li>
