            <h3>REUSE collection station</h3>

            <p> Our school has now set up a collection station for waste and unwanted items to be repurpsed for a better cause. Please save the following items and deliver to the REUSE station in the covered area where the vending machine used to reside (between HKFC and the Canteen):

                Plastic food storage products/cling wrap/snap lock bags, all oral care waste including tooth brushes and floss containers, The Collective NZ yogurt pouches and all packaging, Fonterra pouches, Nescafe Dolce Gusto and Nespresso coffee capsules. Sent to Terracycle to be made into moulded plastic products and Rangi receives cash to donate to Cool Earth.
                Mobile phones. Sent to Remobile. This initiative supports Sustainable Coastlines in NZ.
                Creative junk. Offered to Rangi Ruru Preschool or Creative Junk.
                Hazardous waste. Taken to CCC Eco Drop to ensure it does not contaminate landfill.
                Egg cartons and milk bottles. Returned to suppliers for reuse.
                Clothes, sports gear and clan gear. Reused onsite or donated to charity.
                Bras and togs. Oncology Department at Christchurch Hospital sends to Pacific Islands
                Medical gear/splints/moon boots. Donated to Pacific Island hospitals. A Rangi initiative.
                Books and stationery. Reused or donated to schools/charities.
                Fresh fruit and vegetables. Donated to The City Mission/used by staff when cooking at Ronald McDonald House or the City Mission Shelter.
                Please support these initiatives. In doing so, as a community we can significantly reduce waste to landfill. Each product collected as part of the Terracycle program earns Rangi Ruru 2 cents. This quickly adds up and we can earn money from waste to support our nominated charity Cool Earth. Cool Earth is proven to be an effective charity making a difference in protecting/supporting rain forests and their communities. We also have the opportunity of winning $1000 through the Colgate Oral Care competition by collecting tooth brushes, tooth paste, floss containers and all associated packaging (any brands). A thousand dollars can make a significant difference and provide alternatives to deforestation, for those living in rainforests.</p>

        <h3>Tips for sustainabile practice at home</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use cloth bags for shopping to reduce your impact on the environment. New Zealanders use over 1.6
                billion plastic bags in the home every year. 4.3 million are being thrown away each day!</li>

            <li>Walk or bike, bus or car pool to school/work. Rangi is surrounded by beautiful parks and reserves. If
                you need to drive, park a few blocks away and walk some of the way. Incidental exercise adds up,
                increases fitness and makes you feel good.</li>

            <li>Check exfoliating scrubs, facial cleansers and toothpaste ingredients for plastic microbeads. Evidence
                shows these and other tiny particles of plastic are entering our waterways and embedding themselves in
                the marine food chain.</li>

            <li>Research and support effective charities, proven through evidence to be doing the most possible good
                with donated money. For further information email c.low@rangiruru.school.nz</li>

            <li>Soft plastics capable of being scrunched into a ball can now be dropped back to New World, The Warehouse
                or Pac n Save to be reused and made into fitness circuits, road bollards, park benches and playground
                equipment. Bags to collect include bread bags, frozen food bags, toilet paper packaging, confectionary
                and biscuit wrap, chip bags, pasta, cereal and rice bags, courier bags etc. A soft plastics collection
                has also been set up at Rangi. </li>
